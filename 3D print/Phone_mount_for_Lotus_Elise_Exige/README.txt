# Summary

This is a cell phone mount for the Lotus Elise/Exige that clips onto the dash without any fasteners and yet still provides a very sturdy attachment.

The 3D printed bracket retains a 1/4-20 (standard tripod thread) hex head bolt.  You will need a bolt and a tripod adapter that fits your phone to assemble the mount.

I'm also including a custom holder for a Samsung Galaxy S7 that attaches to the bracket with a 1/4-20 hex nut.  The generic tripod adapter works fine but the custom holder is nicer to use.

Here are the parts I used:

1/4-20 x 1/2" hex head bolt:

Since the interior of the car can get quite hot, I printed this in PETG rather than PLA.
